I was just currious how inflation effects the GDP and GNI per capita of the USA. I took the data from [The World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org), and the CPI data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/). I then adjusted the GDP and GNI data for inflation by using the CPI. 

The methods for determining CPI have often been crticized. Some believe CPI [overestimates inflation](http://www.colorado.edu/economics/courses/econ2020/section6/section6-main.html), while others believe CPI [underestimates inflation](http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/). I was currious to see how an overestimating/underestimating CPI has on the adjusted GDP per capita. So I made plots of GDP per capita with 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% overestimation and underestimation of CPI each year.
